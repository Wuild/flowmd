# Project Guidelines
    
We need to establish some guidelines for our project to ensure consistency and quality in our work. These guidelines will help us maintain a high standard and make it easier for everyone to contribute effectively.

* Create a wysiwyg markdown editor that supports the Common markdown syntax.
* Follow the CommonMark specification for markdown syntax to ensure compatibility and consistency across different markdown parsers.
* Use the existing style main.scss for styling the editor. This will help maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.
* Use the existing plugin system to allow for easy extensibility and customization of the editor. This will enable users to add their own features and functionality without modifying the core codebase.
* Use a consistent coding style across the project. This includes naming conventions, indentation, and file organization.
* Write clear and concise documentation for all components, functions, and modules. This will help new contributors understand the codebase and make it easier to maintain.
